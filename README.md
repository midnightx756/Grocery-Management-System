This is my PCS251 project for the 2nd semester

Here is the problem statement
Grocery Management System (GMS) for Departmental Stores

The Grocery Management System (GMS) is a software application designed to assist departmental stores in efficiently managing their grocery inventory. The system aims to streamline the processes of purchasing, stocking, and selling groceries, ensuring that store owners can maintain an organized inventory and optimize their operations.

The GMS will cater to the management of 10 essential grocery items, defined by the user

By implementing the GMS, departmental stores can:

- Track inventory levels and receive alerts for low-stock items
- Manage supplier information and automate purchase orders
- Monitor sales trends and optimize product placement
- Generate reports for inventory, sales, and profits
- Improve customer satisfaction through efficient inventory management

The GMS will provide a user-friendly interface for store owners and staff to easily navigate and manage their grocery inventory, ultimately leading to increased productivity and profitability.
